    "## LMQL-based Constraint-Guided Decoding for Understanding Human Speech in Embodied Contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to encode speech-act theoretic notions in constraint-guided decoding. The key challenges are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extracting components -- informational content (incl. what objects are they talking about), human intentions for what they want the agent to do with the information\n",
    "2. The terms being extracted are groundable in the robotic action/perception repertoire (collectively, \"robot capabilities\") -- this is what it means for a robot to \"understand\".\n",
    "3. Linking terms with variables -- that is in the command \"pick up the blue ball\", the pickup(), blue() and ball() and DEFINITE() are all refering to the same domain entity -- ball -- which may or may not exist in the real world, but needs a shared identifier for the robot to properly satisfy perceptual constraints"
