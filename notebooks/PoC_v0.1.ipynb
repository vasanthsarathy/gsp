Note, this is where reasoning about the indirect speech act comes into play.

    "### Actions and Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "`Actions` are symbolically specified functions that can be executed by the agent. Each `action` has an associated `action signature` which in turn has a `name`, `parameters` and `description`. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Action Definition:\n",
    "    {'name': 'stack',\n",
    "     'description': 'Stacks one object on top of another object',\n",
    "     'parameters': ['object', 'object']\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `name` is simply a string without spaces or special characters. The `description` is mpre general string containing an NL description of what the action is about. The `parameters` is an ordered list of strings. Each item in the list is a `parameter type symbol` that specifies the `type` that a `variable symbol` and also an `object constant symbol` can take. Note, this is just how actions are defined. Grounded actions have `parameters` that are constant symbols. See below. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "`Concepts` are symbolically specified predicates that can be explicitly tracked by the agent. Each `concept` also has an associated `concept signature` which in turn has a `name`, `parameters` and `description`. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Concept:\n",
    "    {'name': 'on',\n",
    "     'description': 'Checks if an object is top of another object',\n",
    "     'parameters': ['object', 'object']\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grounded vs Lifted\n",
    "\n",
    "A `grounded action` is an action in which all the parameters are replaced with specific `object constant symbols`. Similarly a `grounded concept` is a concept in which all parameters are replaced with specific `object constant symbols`. Note, for a grounded action or concept to be type-matched, the `object constant symbols` must have a `type` that matches the parameter `type` specified in the action/concept definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "A `lifted action/concept` is an action/concept in which one or more parameters are `variable symbols`. Here too, the parameters MUST be type-matched, i.e., any variable or object `constant symbols` must have a `type` that matches the parameter `type` specified in the action/concept definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tethered Action/Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "A `tethered action` is an action that the robot has the ability to execute. A `tethered concept` is a concept that the robot can perceive its truth value from the current state. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Novel Action/Concept \n",
    "\n",
    "A `novel action or concept` is an action or concept that the robot does not already knowledge of. It is not present in the agent's action database or set of conceptual beliefs or consultant capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**: One could think about derived predicates, i.e., concepts that are _only_ defined as the head of horn clauses in Belief. One could argue that these are ungrounded in a way, but they are tethered because they can be infered. But, I am arguing here is that these are defined in terms  of other concepts and as long as they are tethered to a grounded concept, we should be okay. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    Utterance: Evan owns the purple box. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Concepts: \n",
    "    own(obj35, evan), purple(obj35), box(obj35), agent(evan)\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's say the robot has an implemented \"purple\" detector and a \"box\" detector. It also knows that evan is an agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say the robot has no prior knowledge of \"own(X)\", which means it is a new concept. \"own(X)\" is an untethered concept that is also novel. When asserted by the human, the robot will come to believe that \"own(obj35, evan)\", but it cannot infer whether another object is owned by evan or other objects are owned by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "We say here that \"own(X)\" is `untethered` but that doesn't stop the robot from reasoning about it. Crucially, if it has another rule: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "constraintViolation(O) :- own(O,A), holding(O), agent(A), object(O), A!=self. \n",
    "```\n",
    "With this rule and the above fact, the agent can reason that they have violated a constraint, without really understanding what \"ownership\" actually means. \n"

    "\n",
    "#### Core Propositional Content (CPC)\n",
    "The `core propositional content` or `cpc` has to do with the \"thing\" that the speaker is talking about. Searle calls this the propositional content condition. For example, \"The purple box is open\" has a `cpc` of \"isOpen(X)\". \"Open the purple box\" has a `cpc` of \"open(X)\". Note here that \"open\" is an action whereas \"isOpen\" is a concept. We will talk about actions and concepts later. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Supporting Propositional Content (SPC) \n",
    "The `supporting propositional content` or `spc` has to do with constraining information about the `cpc`. So, \"The purple box is open\" has `spc` of {purple(X), box(X), DEFINITE(X)}. Similarly, \"Open the purple box\" has an `spc` of {purple(X), box(X), DEFINITE(X)}. Note the `spc` is the same in both cases. Note, also that the `spc` is a collection of concepts. But it could be more complicated like \"Open the purple box you had opened and closed yesterday\". Again, the `cpc` is still \"open(X)\", but now the `spc` is more complex {purple(X), box(X), DEFINITE(X), ...history(X,\\[open(X), close(X)\\])...}\n",
